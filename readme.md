# Movie Data

Using the `movie_data.csv` which contains text summaries of ~42K movies scraped from wikipedia, this project seeks to answer the following questions:
- What are the 5 most popular genres?
- What words are characteristic of the movie summaries in those genres
- Do we see evidence of [Zipf’s law](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) in the summaries

## Dependencies

Code is written in Python3 and uses the following libraries:
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [nltk](http://www.nltk.org): you must have both the nltk package and all its [data installed](http://www.nltk.org/data.html)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)

## How to run

From the command line located at main.py's root (in an environment with the dependencies listed above) run and provide `main.py` with the `movie_data.csv` as:  

`python3 main.py data/movie_data.csv`

## Repository Structure  

This repository is organized as follows:
- `main.py`: driver Python file which contains all code
- `writeup.pdf`: pdf writeup of my findings for the three problems defined above
- `\data`: directory containing the `movie_data.csv` dataset (to be supplied to `main.py`), and all data `.txt` files with stored tokens to be used by main.py, so that the expensive tokenization process doesn't need to be repeated
- `\plots`: directory containing all matplotlib plots generated by `main.py`

## Database properties

The database has the following properties for all movies:
- `id`: unique integer ID for each film
- `title`: string title
- `genres`: list of strings for genres of each film, for instance `[“Space western”, “Horror”]`
- `summary`: unstructured text summary scraped from the film’s wikipedia page

The database has the following properties for some films:
- `release_date`: can be in the form `mm/dd/yy` or simply `yyyy`, present for most films
- `box_office_revenue`: integer of the USD, only present for a few films
- `runtime`: integer of the total running minutes, present for most films
