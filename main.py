@purpose: Take the movie_data.csv and answer the following questions: 
	1) What are the 5 most popular genres?
	2) What words are characteristic of the movie summaries in those genres
	3) Do we see evidence of Zipfâ€™s law in the summaries
@requirements: Python3.4, pandas, numpy, nltk (and data, see readme)
@arguments: movie_data.csv
